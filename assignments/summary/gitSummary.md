# Git 

 Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
 It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. 

##  Internals

Git has three main states that your files can reside in

- **Modified** means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your
repo yet.
- **Staged means** that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into
your next picture/snapshot.
- **Committed** means that the data is safely stored in your local repo in form of
pictures/snapshots.

- **Workspace** : All the changes you make via Editor(s) (gedit, notepad, vim, nano) is
done in this tree of repository.
- **Staging** : All the staged files go into this tree of your repository.
- **Local Repository** : All the committed files go to this tree of your repository.
- **Remote Repository** : This is the copy of your Local Repository but is stored in some
server on the Internet. All the changes you commit into the Local Repository are
not directly reflected into this tree. You need to push your changes to the Remote
Repository.
