# Introduction to 20hr learning

The traditional approach was if someone wanted to master or learn a skill he/she had to spend 10,000 hours in practising in that field,
But according to **Josh Kaufman**, one can learn a skill within 20 hours with keeping proper important points in mind.


## Key Points
- **Deconstructon of a Skill**
> Deconstruction is the process of taking a big and intimidating skill and breaking it down into small and manageable pieces.
It is the process of identifying the required skill to learn.
- **Start Small**
> Start small by taking steps towards learning slow, one step at a time and not trying to inculcate everything at the same time.
- **Remove Distractions**
> Distractions tend to stray away from our goal of learning and make us procrastinate more rather than giving the effort to develop a skill. 
We have to commit ourselves to learn without any distractions.
- **Availability**
> Before starting to learn something to develop a skill, we need to ensure that we have all the available resources to start with because if any one of them is unavailable, 
it will decline the learning curve.
