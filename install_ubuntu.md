# **Why Ubuntu 16.04 and not this other distro ?**
It is because of package dependencies, We have solved all possible issues on 16.04 and there are many issues in other distros
which we don't want to get busy solving since our main goal is our curriculum and not solving Ubuntu or other Linux issues.
